# Changelog

All notable changes to BookSharez are recorded here — an **internal engineering
record**, not all entries are user-facing.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).
The project has not had a tagged release yet, so everything to date lives under
**[Unreleased]**. The granular record is the git history; this file is the
curated summary. Forward-looking work lives in [ToDo.md](ToDo.md); decision
rationale lives inline in the relevant docs (e.g. the ADR in
[docs/PHASE_1_MVP_SPEC.md](docs/PHASE_1_MVP_SPEC.md)).

## [Unreleased]

_Phase 1 backend foundation + documentation. Work to date: 2026-06-14 – 2026-06-15._

### Added
- **Real Supabase authentication** — sign up, login, logout, and session
  persistence, replacing the prototype's fake login. (`aa89912`)
- **Supabase browser client** in `js/supabase-config.js` (project URL +
  publishable/anon key only).
- **Database schema applied in Supabase** — `books`, `listings`,
  `listing_photos` with indexes, RLS policies, and Storage policies, captured as
  a paste-ready `db/schema.sql`. (`f35800b`, `a8aae0b`)
- **`books` RLS** — enabled with a public read-only policy; writes restricted to
  the service-role Edge Function. Deliberate, documented deviation from the
  verbatim spec (which left `books` without RLS). (`9ae1014`)
- **RLS test harness** `db/rls_test.sql` — seeds two users + listings and runs 8
  cross-user access checks under the real `anon`/`authenticated` roles.
  **All 8 pass.** (`1d4bd56`, `e294b5f`)
- **`listing-photos` Storage bucket** settings recorded: private, 5 MB cap,
  `image/jpeg`+`png`+`webp` only. (`2425c3b`)
- **Design docs:**
  - `docs/ISBN_LOOKUP_DESIGN.md` — the `isbn-lookup` Edge Function: cache-first
    against the `books` table, ISBNdb → Google Books fallback, rate-limiting
    approach (ToDo items 9 & 10). (`fde9349`)
  - `docs/SEARCH_SYSTEMS.md` — the two distinct "search" systems (seller-side
    ISBN lookup vs. buyer-side local browse); affiliate fallback marked
    deferred. (`31919bd`)
- **This `CHANGELOG.md`.**

### Changed
- **Architecture pivot recorded:** vanilla HTML/CSS/JS + Supabase Edge Functions
  chosen over Next.js (ADR in `docs/PHASE_1_MVP_SPEC.md`).
- **Docs converted off Next.js/React/TypeScript** to vanilla JS + Edge Functions
  across `PHASE_1_MVP_SPEC.md`, `SECURITY_CHECKLIST.md`,
  `ERROR_HANDLING_PATTERNS.md`, `PHASE_1_OPERATIONS.md`, and `env.example`:
  TS code samples converted to JS; `middleware.ts`/`app/api` route handlers →
  Edge Functions; Zod → plain-JS validation; `process.env.*` → `Deno.env.get`;
  `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` dropped; Vercel → host-agnostic. (`f35800b`, `3ce3acc`)
- **Prototype condition values** aligned to the spec's 4 grades (`like_new`,
  `very_good`, `good`, `acceptable`) — dropped `fair`/`poor`, hyphens →
  underscores — so listing inserts pass the DB CHECK constraint. (`96e90ab`)
- **Buyer-side search heading** toggles to "Search Results" during a query and
  back to "Featured Books" when cleared. (`31919bd`)

### Fixed
- **Hero search appeared broken:** results render in the Featured section below
  the fold and the page never scrolled there (and "two" matched none of the 6
  demo books). `searchBooks()` now scrolls results into view. (`31919bd`)

### Removed
- Stray root duplicate of `PHASE_1_OPERATIONS.md` (pre-conversion copy) and
  `claude-project-files.zip`.

### Deferred (decisions pending)
- **AI pricing provider** (Anthropic vs OpenAI) — decide at pricing-function
  build time; docs lean Anthropic. (`2037c41`)
- **ISBNdb Basic plan** subscription — start when the ISBN lookup build begins.
  (`2037c41`)

### Project
- Initialized git; committed the prototype baseline. (`e708d78`)
